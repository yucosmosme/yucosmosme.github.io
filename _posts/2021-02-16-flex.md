Flex is an easy and intuitive way to organize multiple items. Also it is good for customizing their sizes and positions especially horizontally. There are other ways to orginize items such as `table`, `float` and `inline-block`. But these have problems such as clear and white space. So I got to prefer to use flex.

First, you need box container and boxes inside of it. 

```
<div class="box-container">
  <div class="box"></div>
  <div class="box"></div>
  <div class="box"></div>
</div>
```

attributes applied to box-container and inner box are different. 
On box-container you can use `display`, `flex-flow`, `justify-content` etc. 
On inner boxes you can use `order`, `flex`, `align-self` etc.

Here is one simple example I used in my code.
Items are set dynamically and I needed to arrange 4 items in a row. All same width and align center.

*Vue 
```
<div class="box-container">
  <div class="box" v-for="(item, index) in isTopList">
    <img slot="image" v-bind:src="item.fullImg">
  </div>
</div>
```

*css
```
.box-container{ 
  max-width: 1200px;
  margin: 10px auto; /*aligning the container center*/
  display: flex; /*important*/
  text-align: center;
  justify-content: center; /* when there are margin spaces, they goes to the left and right sides only, not between boxes. */
  flex-wrap: wrap; /* when there is not enough space in the container, overflowing boxes go down. */
  align-items: center; 
  align-content: flex-start; /* If container height is bigger than box heights, boxes stick to the top */
  align-items: flex-start; /* if sizes of each box are different, boxes stick to the top */
}
.box{
  min-width: 20%; /* I put this attribute to align only 4 boxes in one row out of max-width 1200px. */
  display: flex; /*important*/
  flex: 1;  /* if flex of each box is 1, width ratio of each box is 1:1:1... In my case, box number is dynamically set and all of boxes have same one attribute. */
  margin: 27px 11px 20px 11px; /*margin between boxes*/
  text-align: center;
  -webkit-box-pack: center; /* to align text center in flex box */ 
  -ms-flex-pack: center; /* to align text center in flex box */
  justify-content: center; /* to align text center in flex box */
}
```
