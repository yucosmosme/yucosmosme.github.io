> Heroku is cloud platform service for building, running, operating applications. It supports various Programming languages such as Java, Node.js, Python. It is very simple and easy to use. It is good for small size projects. 

> I deployed my Node.js based backend project on Heroku and created ClearDB -mySQL which is supported by Heroku. (Frontend project is deployed on Netlify.)


## 1. Start

If you don't have Heroku account, sign up : [heroku](https://www.heroku.com/home).
Create New app.

## 2. Backend project setting

2-1. Heroku works with git. Make it sure that you add `node_modules` directory in `.gitignore` so it won't be added to your git repository.

2-2. set the port as `const PORT = process.env.PORT || 5000`. (When I successfully ran the project it didn't run on 5000 port.) 

2-3. `Procfile` is not required anymore. Instead, you MUST have `package.json` on your root directory of your git repo. Also, Heroku's basic building script is `npm start` unless you change. If there isn't `package.json` on your root directory or there isn't `npm start` script in `package.json`, error will occur.

My project structure looks like:

```
Project
 |_ frontend
 |_ backend
```

`package.json`s were in frontend and backend directory seperately. So there was no `package.json` in root Project directory which created an error. 

In this case, you can either 

- create `package.json` on root directory and redirect it to backend's `package.json` by its script 
- Or just have frontend and backend repos seperately. 
 
I chose the first option.

My `package.json` script in root directory looks like: 

```json
"scripts": {
	"heroku-prebuild": "cd backend && npm i && npm i pm2",
  "start": "cd backend && npm run build"
 }
```
If backend project was in root directory, Heroku will automatically find `node_modules` and run `npm install`.
Since mine wasn't, I had to specify `npm i` and `npm i pm2` in scripts.

2-4. specify node version in `package.json` (root)

```json
  "engines": {
    "node": "14.x"
  }
```

## 3. Deploying

3-1. Download Heroku cli. Check `$ heroku --version` if download succeeded.

3-4. deploy

```
$ heroku git:remote -a [your app name]  # If you already have git repo, copy it once.
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "message"
$ git push origin main 
$ git push heroku main 
```
## 4. DataBase setting

4-1. Before creating database in Heroku, you MUST fill out your creditcard info in `account-billing` section.

4-2. Create database using ClearDB MYSQL on resources tap.

4-3. Once successfully created, you can see database information on `Settings - Config Vars`

It looks like 

`mysql://aaaaaaaaaaaa:bbbbbbbbbbbbb@ccccccccccc.net/dddddddddddd?reconnect=true`

each means

```
aaaaaaaaaaaa -> User
bbbbbbbbbbbbb -> password
ccccccccccc.net -> host
dddddddddddd -> database name
```

Test connection with the info.

## 5. Logs

If there is any error, check logs as below:

```
$ heroku logs
$ heroku logs --tail
```
