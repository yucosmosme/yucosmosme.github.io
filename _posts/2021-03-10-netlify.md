> My company projects were deployed by AWS. AWS has a lot of options for big projects but costs a lot of money and takes good amount time for setting options - I have several projects in one EC2, so I had to put frontend static folders to S3 and connect to Cloud Front for SSL and did other settings.

## 1. Prepare your project

If your static project is ready, push it on your Github.

## 2. Create new site on Netlify 

Sign up Netlify and click `New site from git`.

They offer solutions like Github, GitLab, Bitbucket. I chose Github.

Choose your repository that you want to deploy. and click Install.

Fill out infos as how your project looks like.

They automatically make your site's domain name. You can customise it or change it to your own domain name.

If deploy fails, check your deploy log and fix your code.

I had some errors as below :

- **"build.command" failed** 

![Image Alt error](/assets/images/posts/20210310_182309.png)

I just filled out `dist` for the publish directory, but it had to be actually `front/dist`. Because the directory was wrong, Netlify couldn't locate where to find build command.

- **TypeError: merge is not a function**
**TypeError: webpackMerge is not a function**

On my project, webpack works fine - both development and production mode. But Netlify didn't recognize `webpackmerge` or `merge` function, so I reinstalled `webpack-merge` version 5. It worked.

- **Module not found: Error: Can't resolve 'babel-loader' in '/opt/build/repo/frontend'**
**node_modules doesn't exist**

Last error, they couldn't find `babel-loader`! For the first place, `node_modules` didn't exist!

It happes when you use `yarn.lock` and don't use it. After removing `yarn.lock` and all error was gone!
