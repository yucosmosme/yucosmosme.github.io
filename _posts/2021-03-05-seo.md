> After creating github blog, it is recommended to set SEO. To do so, you need

- `sitemap.xml`
- `rss.xml` or `feed.xml`
- `robots.txt`

on your root directory. If your gitBlog theme supports SEO settings, it may be located in different directory.

## 1. Creating sitemap.xml
Install `gem 'jekyll-sitemap` to your site's Gemfile and run bundle.
If you haven't installed ruby or bundler, download ruby.

If `gem command` is still not found, restart your computer.

on command line, change directory to your git blog repository. 

`gem install jekyll bundler`
`bundle install`
`bundle exec jekyll serve`

Then jekyll-sitemap librarly will install `_site` directory and files inside. If not, bundle may not have been properly installed.

Visit your blog sitemap and see if it's properly created. URL should be `your blog url/sitemap.xml`

Mine is 
`https://yucosmosme.github.io/sitemap.xml`


## 2. Adding to Google Search Console

visit [Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console/about)

click `start now`

![Image](/assets/images/posts/20210313_184204.png){: width="70%"}

click `add property`.
add your blog address.

Add sitemap url.

Get it's own site verification code and add it to your head like below:

```html
<head>
  (...)
<meta name="google-site-verification" content="your-site-verification-code">
</head>
```

My `minimal-mistakes` theme offers the function inside, so all I had to do is adding verification code to `_config.yml`.

Now done! 
If it's successfully added, you can check it on your blog's html code in develpment mode as below.

```html
<head>
  (...)
<meta name="google-site-verification" content="your-site-verification-number">
</head>
```

It may take a day for performance measuring since your blog is registered to google search console.

## Adding to Naver Webmaster
For those who need to register their blogs on Korean search engine, visit [Naver Search Advisor](https://searchadvisor.naver.com/)

You need your Naver account and signed in first.

![Image](/assets/images/posts/20210313_185843.png){: width="70%"}

Click `웹마스터 도구`

![Image](/assets/images/posts/20210313_185902.png){: width="70%"}

Register your blog address.

![Image](/assets/images/posts/20210313_190005.png){: width="70%"}

Click `요청` - `사이트맵 제출`. Register your sitemap.xml

**Regarding RSS feed, Jekyll produces `feed.xml` but Naver Webmaster doesn't accept it and alert `Wrong rss feed` message.

If your blog and sitemal.xml is registered properly, you can check the result from `검증`-`웹 페이지 최적화`. (It would also take a day.)
